        This document provides an overview of the structure of W3C governance.
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The web works thanks to an array of <dfn>web infrastructure</dfn> services, which provide
        "<em>shared means to many ends</em>" ([[?Infrastructure]]) including interoperable standards and other critical
        services. Over the years, the [=community=] has developed a multi-pronged governance system
        to manage this infrastructure. This document makes this governance system more explicit,
        and suggests a number of changes that stem from the recent addition of a [=board=] and 
        [=corporation=]. (It may be worth noting that the current [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/) has become 
        slightly out of date in some of its definitions).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NOTE</strong>: the description provided in this document partially matches current reality but is
        focused on developing a governance architecture that is a better match for the W3C's mission than the 
        current one. The essential changes made here compared to reality are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explicitly placing the [=community=] at the centre.</li>
        <li>Focusing on the infrastructural nature of the work.</li>
        <li>
          Make the AB about the entire institutional structure, including the governance of the infrastructure product
          itself. It is also in charge of contributor welfare which you can think of as a form of community union. 
          This is modelled after the Mondragón governance architecture.
        </li>
        <li>
          The TAG is put in charge of tech strategy and of coordinating horizontal review. There should probably 
          be two separate groups: one for architecture (and that should be a regular HR group) and another for 
          strategy+review (being elected).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>High Level Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The <dfn data-lt="community">web community</dfn> is the set of stakeholders, individual and collective, 
        who rely upon and take part in the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since its founding in 1994, the <dfn>W3C</dfn>'s role has been to provision infrastructure critical to the operation of the web. 
        Over the years, depending on needs, available resources, and strategy, this has taken 
        various forms: often open, interoperable standards but also software products and 
        libraries, test suites, policymaking support, educational material, community organising, or 
        interoperability testing. The [=W3C=] is comprised of the [=consortium=] and, as of 1 January 2023, the 
        [=corporation=]. They work together in support of the [=community=]. The <dfn>W3C Team</dfn>, under the
        leadership of the CEO, provides support for both the [=consortium=] and the [=corporation=] and is also
        part of the [=community=].
      </p>
      <p>
        The role of the <dfn data-lt="W3C corporation">corporation</dfn> is to handle 
        the day-to-day executive and operational aspects in support of [=web infrastructure=]. The 
        <dfn data-lt="W3C CEO">CEO</dfn> leads the [=corporation=]. The <dfn>Board</dfn> exerts 
        oversight over the [=CEO=] and aspects of the corporation within its purview as a Delaware
        corporation, and through its certificate of incoporation and bylaws. The Board's oversight roles include
        setting the [=corporation=]'s strategy and monitoring its financial health. By design, the Board does not 
        play a direct role in the technical development of [=web infrastructure=].
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>consortium</dfn>'s role is to convene the [=community=] stakeholders most actively 
        involved in the provision of [=web infrastructure=] and to define and maintain the institutions 
        that organise their cooperation. The <dfn class="export">Advisory Board (AB)</dfn> oversees the institutional 
        aspects of the [=consortium=]'s work and guarantees that [=web infrastructure=] is provided and governed as a 
        commons. It is also responsible for maintaining and improving the work conditions of all those in the 
        community who contribute to the W3C's mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        <dfn>Horizontal review</dfn> is the cornerstone of an integrated approach to [=web infrastructure=], 
        ensuring to the extent possible that the many moving parts of [=web infrastructure=] operate 
        coherently and as intended. It is operated by review groups (acting as [=independent agencies=]) that each 
        regulate foundational aspect of [=web infrastructure=]. The <dfn class="export">TAG</dfn> is tasked with the 
        coordination of [=horizontal review=] and with the technical strategy of [=web infrastructure=].
        Currently, horizontal review includes topics of accessibility, internationalization, privacy, security, and 
        Web architecture but it could be extended to additional domains. All W3C standards must undergo [=horizontal review=]
      </p>
      <p>
        An <dfn>independent agency</dfn> is a body that has authority over a given domain with meaningful independence
        from the people or entities that its reviews apply to.
