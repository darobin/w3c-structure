      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The web works thanks to an array of <dfn>web infrastructure</dfn> services, which provide
        "<em>shared means to many ends</em>" ([[?Infrastructure]]) including interoperable standards and other critical
        services. Over the years, the [=community=] has developed a multi-pronged governance system
        to manage this infrastructure. This document makes this governance system more explicit,
        and suggests a number of changes that stem from the recent addition of a [=board=] and 
        [=corporation=]. (It may be worth noting that the current Process document has become 
        slightly out of date in some of its definitions).

      <h2>High Level Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The <dfn data-lt="community">web community</dfn> is the set of stakeholders, individual and collective, 
        who rely upon and take part in the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>W3C</dfn>'s role is to provision infrastructure critical to the operation of the web. 
        Over the years, depending on needs, available resources, and strategy, this has taken 
        various forms: often open, interoperable standards but also software products and 
        libraries, policymaking support, educational material, community organising, or 
        interoperability testing. The [=W3C=] is comprised of the [=consortium=] and the 
        [=corporation=], working in support of the [=community=].
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn data-lt="W3C corporation|team">corporation</dfn> (aka team)'s role is to handle 
        the day-to-day executive and operational aspects in support of [=web infrastructure=]. The 
        <dfn data-lt="W3C CEO">CEO</dfn> leads the [=corporation=]. The <dfn>Board</dfn> exerts 
        oversight over the [=CEO=] and supports setting the [=corporation=]'s strategy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>consortium</dfn>'s role is to convene the [=community=] stakeholders most actively 
        involved in the provision of [=web infrastructure=] and to define and maintain the institutions 
        that organise their cooperation. The <dfn class="export">AB</dfn> oversees the institutional aspects of the 
        [=consortium=]'s work and guarantees that [=web infrastructure=] is provided and governed as a 
        commons. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <dfn>Horizontal review</dfn> is the cornerstone of an integrated approach to [=web infrastructure=], 
        ensuring to the extent possible that the many moving parts of [=web infrastructure=] operate 
        coherently and as intended. It is operated by independent agencies (review groups) that each 
        regulate foundational aspect of [=web infrastructure=]. The <dfn class="export">TAG</dfn> is tasked with the 
        coordination of [=horizontal review=] and with the technical strategy of [=web infrastructure=].
